          <th>What I have created is a color palette. I created this by using the table tag but having them in the same row and this is done by adding one tr tag meaning one table row. I was then able to input the color palette by adding their hex codes into CSS and expanding them to become a reasonable size.</th>
          <th>What I have created is a basic Scratch game that consists of a movable sprite controlled by the arrow keys. I learned the basics of Scratch by following the tutorial and innovating the first project into a game. I followed the instructions that Scott Lukesh had written. You can follow the instructions by going to his website, <a href="http://www.scottlukesh.com/">www.scottlukesh.com</a></th>
          <th>I am remixing a game called EmojiFactory. EmojiFactory was created by gumboygames. What I want to do differently is add a new sprite that pops up after starting or pressing the green flag. The sprite will be a faded question mark and once you click on it or figure out the "Easter Egg", you will be asked a single question. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLowwFizwLdyThh0gxD5JuqxE5bSB_r2PKoqXtmVl70/edit?usp=sharing">Scratch Remix Game</a>

          <th>In this program, I made an Interactive Fiction Story about a boy in High School. The program consist of coding that allows you to choose different routes throughout the story. There are approximately 3 different routes you can choose as the story progresses. This program is show my level of mastery in Python 2.7 and how I can combine different codes to make a story.</th>
